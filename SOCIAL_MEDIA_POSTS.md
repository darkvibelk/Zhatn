## Reddit Post (r/webdev or r/reactjs)

**Title:** Built a privacy-focused chat app - Zhatn [React + Supabase]

**Body:**

Hey r/webdev! 👋

I just finished building and deploying Zhatn, a real-time chat application with a focus on privacy and security. Thought I'd share it here for feedback!

**Live Demo:** https://zhatn.vercel.app

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React (functional components) + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time)
- Deployment: Vercel
- State Management: React hooks (no Redux)

**Key Features:**
- Phone number authentication (OTP-based, testing mode)
- Real-time messaging with Supabase subscriptions
- Session management (force logout on new device)
- Client-side image compression (300x300 JPEG @ 0.7 quality)
- Long-press delete for chats
- RLS policies for database security

**Challenges I faced:**
1. CORS issues with Cloudflare Pages (switched to Vercel)
2. Image size optimization (solved with canvas compression)
3. Session management across devices

**What I learned:**
- Supabase real-time is incredibly powerful
- Proper RLS policies are crucial for security
- Client-side image compression saves bandwidth

**Open to feedback!** What would you add/change?
